    			<p>It is with great pleasure and honor to lead UP-SURP and work with the faculty, staff, alumni and graduate students with the aim of transforming lives through education, research and training, as we pursue the many opportunities that come our way. I fervently hope that the School will reach new heights under my leadership as it continues to pursue its mission of producing outstanding urban and regional planners. This is of critical importance as we confront the new development challenges ahead.</br></br>

UP-SURP has come a long way, not only in years as we celebrate this 2012 its 47th year of its founding but also as the only graduate and premier school of planning in the country. It takes pride in its accomplishments to fulfill its 4-fold mandate of graduate education, research, training and extension services.</br></br>

UP-SURP will continue to be innovative and creative in its offerings of urban and regional planning courses, especially in the directions of sustainability, climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, resettlement and redevelopment, transport impact assessment and planning, strategic environmental assessment, and public private partnerships for the urban environment.  This is to keep the relevance of the planning education to current realities and address the need for more specialized planners especially in the areas of estate, public works/infrastructure, transportation, and environment and natural resources.</br></br>

Finally, I wish to renew my assurance of highest regard to all, reiterate my keen interest to work collaboratively with international organizations and institutions, with the government, private sectors, civil societies, and especially with the UP-SURP family, particularly in the context of empowering our local government units in this era of global change and in shaping the future of our cities and municipalities for a better quality of life.</p>
